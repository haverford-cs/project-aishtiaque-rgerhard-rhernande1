# Stock Market Predictor (name subject to change?)

This is the final project by Rudy Hernandez, Russell Gerhard and Ahmed Ishtiaque for Haverford College's Fall 2019 Machine Learning course.

Our goal is to implement a machine learning model to predict a chosen company's stock price the day after a chosen date, based on the stock's historical data.


#### Dataset
The dataset we are using is the [Huge Stock Market Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs) from Kaggle. This dataset provides CSVs containing open, high, low, and closing prices as well as volume of stocks from numerous companies till November 11, 2017.
